"For a 70-kg lean male, this equals 56 g/d of protein which is greater than
the estimated obligate daily loss in body protein from the shedding of
cells, secretions, and other miscellaneous functions (approximately 6 to
8 g/d for a 70-kg man) and has been assumed to be due to
inefficient utilization of amino acids for synthesis of replacement proteins
and other amino acid-derived products. In
part, it also may represent the technical difficulty in determining a mini-
mal daily protein requirement."
